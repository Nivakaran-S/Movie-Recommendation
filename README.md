A recomendation system is a system that recommends you similar kinds of content based on your choices

There are 3 types of recommendation system:
1. Content based
- Recommends similar content based on you past choices
2. Collaborative filtering
- If 2 users' behaviours are same in choosing the content, one user will get recomendations based on the other user's choice
3. Hybrid
- Combination of content based and collaborating filtering 
e.g., Netflix recommendation system

- Cosine similarity is applied here
- Cosine similarity tries to find the angle between 2 vectors
- Lower the angle, lower the distance, higher the angle, higher the distance
